Steps to get the backend working on your own workspace:

1 - At the end of this file you will find three urls which need to be 
    changed and their specific location. The only change needed is to change the word 
    arnolf inside the url with your own c9 user.

2 - erlang-php-bridge.php is a file that needs to be attatched to an apache server. 
    Since this is a new workspace and nothing has been started then you need to open 
    the file and click on run. This only needs to be done once. Once you see the apache 
    msg on the terminal you can close that terminal.

3 - Follow directions on CDH.md to run the program in the terminal.
